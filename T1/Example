| means concurrently code execution
Blocking Example (tickets are examples):

Buffer is full

W1 W2 R1

W1 acquires ticket (42) and waits for it's turn
W2 acquires ticket (43) and waits for it's turn
R1 acquires ticket (44) and waits for it's turn
W1 turn
W1 can't write because buffer is full
W1 get write ticket (20) (Global is 19)
PendingWrites = 1 
W1 releases global ticket (42) (Ticket now is 43)

W1 waits for write turn | W2 turn
W2 can't write because buffer is full
W2 get write ticket (21)
PendingWrites = 2 
W2 releases global ticket (43) (Ticket now is 44)


R1 turn
R1 can read data
Read data
Before releasing global ticket check for PendingWrites
There are PendingWrites so increment writeticket
Wait for all pending writes and reads
W1 releases global ticket (44) (Ticket now is 45)
